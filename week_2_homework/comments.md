Here's where you can find my comments on you work as you progress...always look for the comments.md file :)

Great job with the About me page! The only comment I have is pay attention to spacing and indentation in your files to make sure your code is organized clearly to anyone who reads it, especially when you need to make changes. For example, make sure all the elements inside the 'body' tag are children of it.

Same goes for the resume page. Really good job cloning it, just more attention to space. The 'About Me' and 'Resume' links are off center...try making them a separate row and control the spacing like we did with the column exercise.

Keep up the good work!
